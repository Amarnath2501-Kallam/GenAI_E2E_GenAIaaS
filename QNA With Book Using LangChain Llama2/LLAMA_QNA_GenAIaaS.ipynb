Leaps in \\nhuman imagination, vast amounts \\nof data on hundreds of topics, \\nand humble algorithms can be \\ncombined to create a radical new \\nway of thinking about data.

At Booz Allen, we built an industry-leading team of  \\nData Scientists. Over the course of hundreds of analytic \\nchallenges for dozens of clients, we’ve unraveled the DNA of \\nData Science. We mapped the Data Science DNA to unravel the \\nwhat , the why , the who and the  how . \\nMany people have put forth their thoughts on single aspects of  \\nData Science. We believe we can oﬀer a broad perspective on the \\nconceptual models, tradecraft, processes and culture of Data \\nScience. Companies with strong Data Science teams often focus \\non a single class of problems – graph algorithms for social \\nnetwork analysis and recommender models for online shopping \\nare two notable examples. Booz Allen is diﬀerent. In our role as \\nconsultants, we support a diverse set of clients across a variety of \\ndomains. /T_his allows us to uniquely understand the DNA of  \\nData Science. Our goal in creating /T_he Field Guide to Data Science  \\nis to capture what we have learned and to share it broadly.  \\nWe want this eﬀort to help drive forward the science and art  \\nof Data Science. \\n/T_his /f_ield guide came from the passion our team feels for  \\nits work. It is not a textbook nor is it a super/f_icial treatment. \\nSenior leaders will walk away with a deeper understanding  \\nof the concepts at the heart of Data Science. Practitioners  \\nwill add to their toolbox. We hope everyone will enjoy  \\nthe journey. »Why Data Science DNA? \\nWe view Data Science as having \\nDNA-like characteristics. Much like \\nDNA, Data Science is composed \\nof basic building blocks that are \\nwoven into a thing of great beauty \\nand complexity. /T_he building blocks \\ncreate the blueprint, but successful \\nreplication also requires carefully \\nbalanced processes and the right  \\nset of environmental conditions.  \\nIn the end, every instance may look \\nsuper/f_icially diﬀerent, but the raw \\nmaterials remain the same./guilsinglright.cap/guilsinglright.cap', metadata={'source': '/content/The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

In statistics \\nthis is referred to as Type I error. \\nAs scientists, we are always \\non the lookout for a new or \\ninteresting breakthrough that \\ncould explain a phenomenon. \\nWe hope to see a pattern in our \\ndata that explains something \\nor that can give us an answer. \\nThe primary goal of hypothesis \\ntesting is to limit Type I error. \\nThis is accomplished by using \\nsmall Į values. For example, \\na Į value of 0.05 states that \\nthere is a 1 in 20 chance that \\nthe test will show that there \\nis something signiﬁcant when \\nin actuality there isn’t. This \\nproblem compounds when \\ntesting multiple hypotheses. \\nWhen running multiple \\nhypothesis tests, we are likely \\nto encounter Type I error. As \\nmore data becomes available \\nfor analysis, Type I error \\nneeds to be controlled. \\nOne of my projects required \\ntesting the difference between \\nthe means of two microarray \\ndata samples. Microarray \\ndata contains thousands of \\nmeasurements but is limited \\nin the number of observations. \\nA common analysis approach \\nis to measure the same genes \\nunder different conditions. If \\nthere is a signiﬁcant enough \\ndifference in the amount of \\ngene expression between the \\ntwo samples, we can say that \\nthe gene is correlated with a \\nparticular phenotype. One way \\nto do this is to take the mean of \\neach phenotype for a particular gene and formulate a hypothesis \\nto test whether there is a \\nsigniﬁcant difference between \\nthe means. Given that we were \\nrunning thousands of these tests \\nat Į = 0.05, we found several \\ndifferences that were signiﬁcant. \\nThe problem was that some \\nof these could be caused by \\nrandom chance. \\nMany corrections exist to \\ncontrol for false indications of \\nsigniﬁcance. The Bonferroni \\ncorrection is one of the most \\nconservative. This calculation \\nlowers the level below which you \\nwill reject the null hypothesis \\n(your p value). The formula is \\nalpha/n , where n equals the \\nnumber of hypothesis tests \\nthat you are running. Thus, if \\nyou were to run 1,000 tests of \\nsigniﬁcance at Į\\x03= 0.05, your \\np value should be less than \\n0.00005 (0.05/1,000) to reject the \\nnull hypothesis. This is obviously \\na much more stringent value.  \\nA large number of the previously \\nsigniﬁcant values were no longer \\nsigniﬁcant, revealing the true \\nrelationships within the data.\\nThe corrected signiﬁcance gave \\nus conﬁdence that the observed \\nexpression levels were due to \\ndifferences in the cellular gene \\nexpression rather than noise. We \\nwere able to use this information \\nto begin investigating what \\nproteins and pathways were \\nactive in the genes expressing \\nthe phenotype of interest.

The goal \\nof chemoinformatic \\nsearch is to predict \\nthe properties that \\na molecule will exhibit as well as to \\nprovide indices over those predicted \\nproperties to facilitate data discovery \\nin chemistry-based research. These \\nproperties may either be discreet (e.g., \\n“a molecule treats disease x well”) \\nor continuous (e.g., “a molecule may \\nbe dissolved up to 100.21 g/ml”).\\nMolecules are complex 3D structures, \\nwhich are typically represented as \\na list of atoms joined by chemical \\nbonds of differing lengths with varying \\nelectron domain and molecular \\ngeometries. The structures are \\nspeciﬁed by the 3-space coordinates \\nand the electrostatic potential \\nsurface of the atoms in the molecule. \\nSearching this data is a daunting \\ntask when one considers that \\nnaïve approaches to the problem \\nbear signiﬁcant semblance to the \\nGraph Isomorphism Problem.[13]\\nThe solution we developed was \\nbased on previous work in molecular \\nﬁngerprinting (sometimes also called \\nhashing or locality sensitive hashing). \\nFingerprinting is a dimensionality \\nreduction technique that dramatically \\nreduces the problem space by \\nsummarizing many features, often \\nwith relatively little regard to the \\nimportance of the feature. When \\nan exact solution is likely to be \\ninfeasible, we often turn to heuristic \\napproaches such as ﬁngerprinting.\\nOur approach used a training set \\nwhere all the measured properties of the molecules were available. We \\ncreated a model of how molecular \\nstructural similarities might affect \\ntheir properties. We began by \\nﬁnding all the sub-graphs of each \\nmolecule with length n, resulting \\nin a representation similar to \\nthe bag-of-words approach from \\nnatural language processing. \\nWe summarized each molecule \\nfragment in a type of ﬁngerprint \\ncalled a “Counting Bloom Filter.”\\nNext, we used several exemplars from \\nthe set to create new features. We \\nfound the distance from each member \\nof the full training set to each of the \\nexemplars. We fed these features into \\na non-linear regression algorithm \\nto yield a model that could be used \\non data that was not in the original \\ntraining set. This approach can be \\nconceptualized as a “hidden manifold,” \\nwhereby a hidden surface or shape \\ndeﬁnes how a molecule will exhibit a \\nproperty. We approximate this shape \\nusing a non-linear regression and a \\nset of data with known properties. \\nOnce we have the approximate \\nshape, we can use it to predict the \\nproperties of new molecules. \\nOur approach was multi-staged and \\ncomplex – we generated sub-graphs, \\ncreated bloom ﬁlters, calculated \\ndistance metrics and ﬁt a linear-\\nregression model.

First, it was \\nnecessary to identify which \\ntime series parameters likely \\naffected product yield. We \\nengaged the client’s domain \\nexperts to identify their hypotheses surrounding the \\nprocess. Once we discerned a \\nset of hypotheses, we identiﬁed \\nthe sensors that collected the \\nrelevant data. \\nWe began initial data processing, \\nwhich included ﬁltering \\nbad values and identifying \\npatterns in the time series. We \\nthen needed to segment the \\ndata streams into individual \\nproduction runs. We identiﬁed a \\nsensor that stored the high-level \\ninformation indicating when a \\nproduction process began. This \\nsensor provided exactly what we \\nneeded, but we quickly noticed \\nthat half of the expected data \\nwas missing. Examining the \\ndata more closely, we realized \\nthe sensor had only been used \\nwithin recent years. We had to \\ntake a step back and reassess \\nour plan. After discussions \\nwith the domain experts, we \\nidentiﬁed a different sensor /guilsinglright.cap/guilsinglright.cap\\nTHE FIELD  GUIDE to  DATA  SCIENCE', metadata={'source': '/content/The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science.pdf', 'page': 96}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='that gave us raw values directly \\nfrom the production process. \\nThe raw values included a tag \\nthat indicated the start of a \\nproduction run. The sensor was \\nactive for ev ery production run \\nand could be used reliably to \\nsegment the data streams into \\nproduction runs.\\nNext, we had to determine \\nwhich time series parameters \\naffected product yield. Using the \\ncleaned and processed data and \\na non-parametric correlation \\ntechnique, we compared each \\ntime series in a production \\nrun to all other time series in \\nthat same run. Given the pair-\\nwise similarities, we estimated \\ncorrelation of the similarities \\nto ﬁnal product yield. We then \\nused the correlations as input \\ninto a clustering algorithm to \\nﬁnd clusters of time series \\nparameters that correlated with \\neach other in terms of product \\nyield, not in terms of the time \\nseries themselves. This data analysis was at a scale not \\npreviously possible – millions \\nof comparisons for whole \\nproduction runs. Engineers were \\nable to look at all the data for the \\nﬁrst time, and to see impacts \\nof speciﬁc parameters across \\ndifferent batches and sensors.\\nIn addition to identifying the \\nkey parameters, the engineers \\nneeded to know how to control \\nthe parameters to increase \\nproduct yield. Discussions \\nwith domain experts provided \\ninsight into which time series \\nparameters could be easily \\ncontrolled. This limited the \\ncandidate parameters to only \\nthose that the process engineers \\ncould inﬂuence. We extracted \\nfeatures from the remaining \\ntime series signals and fed \\nthem into our models to predict \\nyield. The models quantiﬁed the \\ncorrelation between the pattern \\nof parameter values and yield, \\nproviding insights on how to \\nincrease product yield.  \\nOur Impact\\nWith controls identiﬁed and desirable patterns quantiﬁed, we \\nprovided the engineers with a set of process control actions \\nto improve product output. The raw sensor data that came \\ndirectly from the production process drove our analysis and \\nrecommendations, thus providing the client with conﬁdence in the \\napproach. The reduction in product yield variability will enable the \\nclient to produce a better product with lower risk at a reduced cost. \\n97 Putting it all Together', metadata={'source': '/content/The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science.pdf', 'page': 97}),\n",

The client hoped the predictions \\ncould be used to optimize their trading activities.

The data volume \\nwas very large, consisting of information from tens of thousands \\nof equities, commodities, and options across most major world \\nmarkets across multiple time intervals. The need to recommend \\na predictive action (go short, go long, stay, increase position size, \\nor engage in a particular option play) with very low latency was \\nan even greater challenge. The team would need to develop an \\napproach that addressed both of these implicit constraints.\\nOur Solution\\nThe client challenged Booz \\nAllen to use 3,500 independent \\nvariables to predict the daily \\nprice movements of 16 ﬁnancial \\ninstruments. The client hid the \\nmeaning and context of the \\nindependent variables, however, \\nforcing our team to perform \\nanalysis without qualitative \\ninformation.
